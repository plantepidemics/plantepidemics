Research focus: Potential of clean-seed programs for re-establishing banana production in disease endemic areas

Investigation of clean-seed program for re-establishing production in disease endemic areas

Despite the increasing use of the dissemination of disease-free planting material, it remains unclear how to optimise 
the potential of of clean-seed program for re-establishing production in disease endemic areas

Bananas are reintroduced by successively planting banana suckers in 0.5ha fields. Smallholder farmers have sourced clean 
seed material, which is 100% virus free, to start growing the initial field. All plants produce new suckers from the 
field are planted to replenish initial field or to expand production into new fields.

**Sustainable strategy** 

Running generated simulations we can provide evidence that introducing virus-free material in areas affected by BBTV along 
with propagation of suckers combined with plant inspection for infection and removal of infected plants can provide a 
sustainable strategy for disease management.

Models were validated using field data from Omondi et al. 2020, Plant Pathology, 69, 1754.

**The benefits**

This model could be adapted to be used for other hosts and pathogens.

We are able to include additional management options (continuous provision of clean-seed, pesticide treatment) into the 
model which increases model robustness and accuracy for determining the benefits of introducing clean seed programmes 
under different farming systems.
