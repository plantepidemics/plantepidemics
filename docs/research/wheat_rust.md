# Wheat rust early warning system

Wheat rust diseases are caused by airborne fungal spores and pose a major threat to food security
all over the Globe, especially in countries in East Africa and South Asia. New emerging strains of the
disease present an intensifying risk of severe crop loss.

As a result of the relentless efforts of many collaborating organisations (University of Cambridge,
Met Office, CIMMYT, and several others in-country), an Early Warning System has been established
to provide a daily near-real time weeklong forecast of the spread of stem (Puccinia graminis), stripe
(Puccinia striiformis), and leaf (Puccinia triticina) rust in East Africa and South Asia.
Here is the schematic summary of the EWS components (see further details in Allen-Sader et al.
2019):
