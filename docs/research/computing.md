# Epidemiological Data Processing

Group expertise in:

- Spatially-explicit stochastic dynamic epidemiological simulations
- Dealing with large datasets
- HPC computing
- Environmental suitability calculation
- Mapping
- Fast simulations on large landscapes

Developing advanced integrated systems with: 

- Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Models (LPDM), to capture properties of turbulent wind flow by tracking very large numbers of individual particle trajectories. 

- Eulerian transport models, to capture properties of turbulent wind flow by tracking concentrations of particles at fixed locations. 

- Mean trajectory models which consider the air parcel to be transported solely by the mean wind velocity, neglecting the stochastic velocity component representing turbulent diffusion. 

- Numerical Aerobiological Modelling Environment (NAME): a flexible modelling package developed for particle dispersion by UK Met Office  

- Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model: a flexible modelling package developed for particle dispersion developed by US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  

- MapSpam: an on-line, open access platform providing data for mapping patterns of crop production, compiled from the Spatial Production Allocation Model.

# Interactive Projects

## Webidemics

Webidemics is an interactive public engagement tool designed to introduce the non-specialist to the concepts and purpose
of epidemiological modelling. The on-line tool was published in 2015, with a second version released in 2019.

Quickstart - simply click "Run" and watch an epidemic materialise.

## Phytofighter

Phytofighter is an interactive public engagement tool designed for students in higher education to introduce the
concepts and purpose of epidemiological modelling.
