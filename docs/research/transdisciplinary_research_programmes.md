In 2004, Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) was observed near Kampala, Uganda. Since 2004, it has spread widely throughout previously uninfected regions and threatens production in Central and West Africa. 

Our research focusses on predicting future spread and optimal management strategies to counteract spread in endemic and currently uninfected regions.

Our research shows that integrated aerobiological epidemiology modelling systems are advantageous  for explaining how 
weather events facilitate relocation of desert locust movement between Yemen over the Gulf of Aden and the East African 
continent.
