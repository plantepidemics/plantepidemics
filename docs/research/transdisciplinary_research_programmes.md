<span style="font-size:16pt;font-weight:bold">Modelling long-range atmospheric transport of crop diseases</span>

Some of the greatest challenges to food production in low- and middle-income countries arise when crops are devastated 
by the sudden outbreak of destructive migratory insects and diseases.  Pests and pathogenic spores can be channelled by 
air streams over long distances, crossing international boundaries and continents, bringing severe consequences for crop 
production and livelihoods in previously uninfected geographical areas.


Forecasting risks of invasion at continental scale, requires simulation models and visualization tools for estimating 
pest dispersal, range and intensity (spore or insect load), to forewarn national plant health agencies and enable 
contingency plans to be implemented in advance. The challenge is the quantity of data that are involved for interpretation 
and visualization of spatiotemporal dynamics of atmospheric transport of crop pathogens and insect pests, requiring 
tools that are capable of processing the data in a reasonable time, so that pest and disease warnings can be rapidly 
disseminated to regional plant health authorities, government agencies and extension services, in countries at risk. 

<span style="font-size:16pt;font-weight:bold">Our team has explored how 3-D visualization technologies can link 
time-dependant meteorological data to atmospheric transport models to produce 3-D visual representations of pest and 
disease movements at regional and continental scales.</span>

##Cassava Responsive

**Location: Sub-Saharan Africa**

<img src="../../images/cbsd.jpg" alt="Cassava brown streak disease" width="400"/>

In 2004, Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) was observed near Kampala, Uganda. Since 2004, it has spread widely throughout previously uninfected regions and threatens production in Central and West Africa. 

Our research focusses on predicting future spread and optimal management strategies to counteract spread in endemic and currently uninfected regions.

##Wheat Rust Early Warning System

**Location: Asia & East africa**

<img src="../../images/deposition_southasia.png" width="600"/>

A daily, near real-time week long forecast of the spread of stem (Puccinia graminis), stripe
(Puccinia striiformis), and leaf (Puccinia triticina). [Read more](wheat_rust.md).


Wheat rust diseases are caused by airborne fungal spores and pose a major threat to food security all over the globe, especially in countries in East Africa and South Asia. New emerging strains of the disease present an intensifying risk of severe crop loss.

As a result of the relentless efforts of many collaborating organisations (University of Cambridge, Met Office, CIMMYT, EIAR and ATA), an Early Warning System has been established to provide a daily near-real time weeklong forecast of the spread of stem (Puccinia graminis), stripe (Puccinia striiformis), and leaf (Puccinia triticina) rust in Ethiopia. The system has recently been extended to include Kenya in East Africa and Nepal and Bangladesh in South Asia (the latter in collaboration with CIMMYT-Bangladesh, NARC, BWMRI, DHM, DAE, and EMBRAPA).

Here is the schematic summary of the EWS components (see further details in [Allen-Sader et al. 2019](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab4034)):

<img src="../../images/EWS_flowchart_resized.PNG" alt="EWS flowchart"/>

The modelling involves a combination of meteorological and epidemiological models with additional inputs from in-country surveillance coordinated by CIMMYT. The team in Cambridge is responsible for the development and maintenance of the modelling elements of the EWS, including the adaptation of a particle dispersal model (NAME) originally developed by the UK Met Office for rust spores. The UK Met Office also provides seven-day weather forecasts for the target countries to drive the models, giving farmers a three-week window to apply fungicides to prevent rust epidemics. The models are also being used pre-season to assess risks from new races of wheat rust and to inform the selection of crop varieties likely to confer resistance.

##Banana Bunchy Top Disease (BBTD) Responsive

**Location: Benin, Nigeria, Australia**

![](../../images/bbtv.png)

Research focus: Potential of clean-seed programs for re-establishing banana production in disease endemic areas

Investigation of clean-seed program for re-establishing production in disease endemic areas

Despite the increasing use of the dissemination of disease-free planting material, it remains unclear how to optimise 
the potential of of clean-seed program for re-establishing production in disease endemic areas

Bananas are reintroduced by successively planting banana suckers in 0.5ha fields. Smallholder farmers have sourced clean 
seed material, which is 100% virus free, to start growing the initial field. All plants produce new suckers from the 
field are planted to replenish initial field or to expand production into new fields.

![](../../images/bbtv_schematic.png)

**Sustainable strategy** 

Running generated simulations we can provide evidence that introducing virus-free material in areas affected by BBTV along 
with propagation of suckers combined with plant inspection for infection and removal of infected plants can provide a 
sustainable strategy for disease management.

![](../../images/bbtv_detection.png)

Models were validated using field data from Omondi et al. 2020, Plant Pathology, 69, 1754.

![](../../images/bbtv_prevalance_1.png)![](../../images/bbtv_prevalance_2.png)

**The benefits**

This model could be adapted to be used for other hosts and pathogens.

We are able to include additional management options (continuous provision of clean-seed, pesticide treatment) into the 
model which increases model robustness and accuracy for determining the benefits of introducing clean seed programmes 
under different farming systems.
