Our research is focused on developing and testing a theoretical framework to understand the mechanisms that control invasion, persistence, scaling and variability of epidemics within changing agricultural and natural landscapes. Our models are used to predict the spread of disease and to identify and optimise economically and ecologically sustainable strategies for disease management, encompassing genetical, chemical, biological and cultural methods. The research involves a synthesis of epidemiological theory, population and evolutionary genetics, landscape ecology and economic modelling. The models are tested using data from extensive field and regional data-sets.

Food Security
Plant pests and disease pose a significant threat to global food security. Accurate predictions of how pest and pathogens will spread are vital for the planning and efficient control of such threats. Using a range of mathematical and statistical methods we are developing models that can forecast where the pathogen/pest is likely to occur and how rapidly it will spread and cause losses once introduced in a given location. These models take into account the environmental suitability of the host landscape as well as the epidemiological dynamics of the pathogen. Such forecasts can be used to help identify strategies that will reduce the risk of spread and to determine optimal monitoring schemes. These types of models are been used by members of the group to predict the spread of new strains of wheat stem rust in Africa, cassava mosaic virus (CMV) and cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) in sub-saharan Africa, bean viruses in Africa and citrus greening (HLB) in the USA.

Diseases in the Natural Environment
The natural environment is under increasing pressure from pests and pathogens. Examples include sudden oak death in USA and Chalara ash dieback, Phythophthora ramorum and Oak processionary moth in the UK. We are developing models to determine the optimal control strategies to minimise the impact out such pest/pathogen outbreaks. In particular, such models take into account the economic costs as well as the damage to the natural environment caused by pest/pathogen invasion.

Crop Modelling
We are also applying mathematical and statistical techniques to model canopy expansion and crop nitrogen uptake in relation to nitrogen supply and temperature. This work is part of the N-Circle project.

Communication Activities
Our group has undertaken a number of outreach activities both with stakeholders and the wider public. Examples include: Cambridge Science Festival, London Science museum lates and development of a web-based interface to illustrate impacts of disease control.


##Experimentation Page
(This is outdated as of before I started my PhD)

The group is involved with a broad spectrum of experimental work on the dynamics and control of epidemics. 

We work at a range of scales that extend from:

the spread of fungal colonies through soil;
pathozone dynamics and disease transmission between individual plants;
disease spread through plant populations using microcosms;
large scale field experiments.
The experimental programme is designed:

to answer specific questions about the epidemiology and control of soil-borne plant disease;
to use these plant systems as experimental models to test hypotheses about more generic epidemiological mechanisms that control the spatial and temporal dynamics and efficiency of control in a broad range of pathogens including aerial pathogens and certain animal and even human diseases.

##Modelling Page

Current modelling work encompasses epidemiological theory, population genetics, landscape ecology and economic modelling. The principal challenge is to capture the essential feature of a complicated biological system, such as an epidemic, in a sufficiently rigorous mathematical formulation that allows us to analyse the spatial and temporal dynamics of the system in order to understand:

why do epidemics occur?
how do they spread?
why are they so variable?
why does disease occur in some regions and not in others?
how can we move from understanding small-scale phenomena at the level of the plant or patch to the larger-scale of epidemic at the field or region?
and how can we improve the efficiency of control?
This involves a range of modelling approaches, mathematical techniques and statistical techniques.

###Modelling approaches

These cover a spectrum that includes the following.

Temporal models are mostly based on compartmental SEIR(Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Removed) models for epidemics but with additional complexities of:
dual sources of inoculum;
quenching as hosts become resistant to infection;
and host dynamics that depend upon infection load.
Stochastic modelsinclude allowance for:
demographic stochasticity (chance effects in transmission from infected to susceptible individuals under otherwise identical conditions);
environmental stochasticity (when transmission parameters are influenced by local or global changes in environmental variables).
Spatially-implicit modelsseek to capture some of the spatial aspects of epidemics within a temporal model by using:
non-linear mixing terms between susceptibles and infected;
moment closure and pair-approximation methods.
Spatially-explicit modelsinclude:
individual-based models, for example, for susceptibles on a lattice often with local mixing;
reaction-advection-diffusion and dispersal-kernel models;
metapopulation models that comprise coupled sub-populations such as fields or different regions.

###Mathematical techniques

The group uses a range of mathematical techniques to model epidemic and other ecological processes. These include:

ordinary and partial differential equations including asymptotic and perturbation theory for model reduction;
stochastic differential equations;
probability theory;
individual-based models for spatial epidemics;
optimisation and control theory;
percolation theory and other methods from statistical physics.

###Statistical techniques

One of the principal characteristics of the group s work is the close interaction between modelling, experimentation and statistical inference to test models and to estimate epidemiological parameters.

We are particularly interested in the role of error structure in epidemic dynamics and in the estimation of variance and higher moments. Examples of recent and current work include:

Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to estimate parameters for spatio-temporal models of epidemics;
Bayesian methods to estimate parameters for replicate epidemics with treatment effects;
Bayesian methods to estimate parameters for stochastic compartmental models;
Likelihood methods for estimation of a range of epidemiological parameters.

###Links with experimentation and testing models against data

The mathematical and experimental programmes are strongly linked. For example, theoretical work on the consequences of seasonality for epidemics in agricultural crops is accompanied by experiments on R. solani infecting radish seedlings in easily-controllable microcosms. Similarly, modelling of the growth of fungi in soil evolves in concert with the experimental techniques in soil physics to control the spatial structures through which micro-organisms spread along with techniques which make it possible to visualise fungi in that environment. Other work on the regional spread of diseases, draw on extensive field data from collaborating organisations and our own archives. Current and previous examples include:

Rhizomania disease of sugar beet
Dutch elm disease
Citrus canker disease
Fungicide resistance
Biological control of Sclerotinia disease
Bubonic plague
Seal distemper disease
control of Rhizoct.
