# Welcome to Plant Epidemics

Plant disease epidemics cause major economic shocks and reductions in food production. Epidemics can be especially harmful in developing countries where communities are often highly dependant on agriculture for subsistence and household income.

This website is a repository for prediction and management simulations of a number of plant disease epidemics by the [Epidemiology and Modelling Group, University of Cambridge](https://www.plantsci.cam.ac.uk/research/chrisgilligan).

*Simulated spread of CBSD from Cameroon to Nigeria. Preliminary results.*

Initially, this repository will focus on Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD). Cassava is a staple crop for approximately 500 million people in sub-Saharan Africa. 

CBSD has been endemic in coastal East Africa and along the shore of Lake Malawi since the 1930s. In 2004, CBSD was observed near Kampala, Uganda. Since
2004, it has spread widely throughout previously uninfected regions and threatens production in Central and West Africa. 

Our research focusses on predicting future spread and optimal management strategies to counteract spread in endemic and currently uninfected regions.
